<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="Introduction"></A>Introduction</DIV>
<P>Import Texture Material is an addon for <A HREF="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</A> 2.82 to
generate material node graphs from texture map archives downloaded from sites like
<A HREF="https://texturehaven.com/">texturehaven.com</A> and
<A HREF="https://cc0textures.com">cc0textures.com</A>. It may work with similar archives
downloaded from other sites; the important thing is that the various component image
files inside the archive are named according to a meaningful convention. The ones
from <TT>texturehaven.com</TT> that I have tried all work; a few from <TT>cc0textures.com</TT>
have odd naming conventions which cause confusion, but the rest are OK.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="Installation"></A>Installation</DIV>

<P>Besides Blender, you will also need the <A
HREF="https://packages.debian.org/buster/unar">unar</A> package
installed for your distribution. This provides the ability to extract
the contents of a whole variety of different archive formats.

<P>To install Import Texture Material for Blender, launch Blender, bring up the
User Preferences window, select the Add-Ons tab, and click the &#8220;Install Add-Ons&#8221;
button. In the file selector dialog that comes up find your way to the directory
containing the <TT>import_texture_material.py</TT> file, select it, and click the
&#8220;Install Add-On...&#8221; button. This will take you back to Blender&#8217;s
User Preferences window, where you should find that Import Texture Material is now listed among
the available add-ons, which you can enable for the current session by ticking its
checkbox.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="BasicUsage"></A>Usage&#8212;Basic</DIV>
<P>Once the addon has been enabled for the current document, you should see an
additional &#8220;Texture Material&#8221; menu item appear in your File→Import menu.

<P>Selecting this menu item will bring up a standard Blender file selector, with some
additional custom items at the upper right.

<P>You can experiment with the effect of these <A HREF="#ImportOptions">later</A>. For now,
navigate to the appropriate place where you downloaded a <TT>.zip</TT> file from one of the
abovementioned texture sites, and open it.

<P>If the texture archive was successfully loaded, you should now be returned to your
document.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="NewMaterial"></A>Nothing Happens?</DIV>

<P>At this point, nothing appears to have changed. But if you select an object
in the 3D View and look in the Materials tab in the Properties window, you should
see a new material appear, with a user count of 0, with its name taken from that of
the <TT>.zip</TT> file you opened:
<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="NewMaterial.png" ALT="New material available"></DIV>

<P>Select this material to apply it to the selected object. In the Shader Editor,
you can see more details about the material that has been created:

<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="MaterialNodeGraph.png" STYLE="width:100%" ALT="Material node graph"></DIV>

<P>All the component images that were recognized by the addon are in a column in the
middle of the node graph, connected in some way to the Principled Shader on the right
to make up the complete material. On the left, the common source of texture coordinates
is fed to the image textures via a Vector Mapping node and a Reroute node; this
conveniently allows you to affect the coordinate source for all the textures at once,
by changing the Mapping parameters or even putting a different input into the Reroute node.

<P>But of course, you are free to edit this node graph however you like.

<DIV CLASS="h2"><A NAME="ImportOptions"></A>Import Options</DIV>

<P>Going back to the custom items in the file selector dialog:

<DIV CLASS="figure"><IMG SRC="FileSelectorCustom.png" ALT="File selector with custom items"></DIV>

<P>These specify various
options that control the automatic construction of the node graph. Checkboxes allow
you to omit components that would normally be included, or include ones that the
addon doesn’t know how to use (currently this is just the Ambient Occlusion map),
or wouldn’t normally use (see below).

<P>Elaborations of the basic object geometry can be specified in three ways: as a
Normal map, a Bump map, or a Displacement map. This addon treats Bump and
Displacement maps as equivalent; they can be converted to Normal maps via a Bump Map
node, or fed to the Displacement terminal of the Material Output node. Or, another
way to use these two would be via a Displace modifier on the object.

<P>Specifying more than one of these three would seem to be redundant; this is why
the addon allows you to specify the preference order for including one of these,
among those available. Or you can check the “Load Unused Maps” box to bring them all
in, then connect them up in the node graph yourself.

<P>The Texture Interpolation/Projection/Extension and Blend settings offer a
convenient way to specify these settings for all the Image Texture nodes at once, at
creation time. Blender does not (currently) offer a convenient way to change
these for multiple Image Texture nodes at once after they have been created.
